# STRV Gatsby Themes

## Themes

### `gatsby-theme-core`

This is the `core` theme for all STRV Gatsby projects. It should be used as the first plugin in most cases.

The `core` theme is opinionated and should only include configuration which is general enough to be usable in all STRV projects (or at least 98%).

### `example`

This is an example usage of `gatsby-theme-core` theme.

- `example/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: Specifies which theme to use and any other one-off config a site might need.
  - `src/`: Source code such as one-off pages or components that might live in
    a user's site.

Run the example with:

```shell
yarn workspace example develop
```
